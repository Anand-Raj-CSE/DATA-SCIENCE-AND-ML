    "## One vs One is technique in which we assume that we have N classes then we train Nc2 parameters classifiers for each two classes. So prediction happens using the majority vote from Nc2 classifiers. This takes O(N^2) time , this can be used for large datasets which cannot be fit into the memory.\n",
    "## Another technique is One vs Rest, here we take a single class and rest of the class(es) are treated as -ve(-1), while training with SVM. This type of classifier will need more memory but will take only N classifiers. Each N classifier will tell wheather the point belongs to that class or not. We can train N classifiers parallely and hence takes O(N) time.\n",
